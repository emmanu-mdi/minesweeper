## Minesweeper

This is a JetBrains project of the Kotlin basics track to learn how to work with lists.

### About
Minesweeper is a game of logic where the player is presented with a field full of hidden mines. The goal is to mark the positions of all mines without setting any of them off. It's not a game of wild guessing: it offers hints showing the number of mines around each cell. One wrong move, and game over!

### Stages
1. **Lay the groundwork** -> Generate your first game fieldwith mines!.
2. **Flexible mines** -> Let the user enter the number of mines in the game field.
3. **Look around you** -> Check how many mines are around.
4. **Prepare for battle** -> Implement the rules of the game.
5. **Battle!** -> Bee a real sapper. Find all the mines.
